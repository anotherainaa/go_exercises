# Collections in Golang

### Arrays and Slices

- We don't have to always set the array size when passing an argument. We can use `...` to set the array to the number of arguments passed in

```golang
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  grades := [...]int{97, 85, 93}
  fmt.Printf("Grades: %v", grades)
}
```

- arrays can contain anything but must have data structures of the same type
- slices are arrays under the hood but can be dynamically re-sized, unlike arrays whereby the size is fixed upon initialization
